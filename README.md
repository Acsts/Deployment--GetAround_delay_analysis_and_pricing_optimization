## Project and repository architecture

This project can be divided in two subprojects with their own code and README : 
1. Delay Analysis (see source code and README [here](https://github.com/Acsts/Deployment--GetAround_delay_analysis_and_pricing_optimization/tree/main/delay_analysis))
2. Car Rental Price Predictor (see source code and README [here](https://github.com/Acsts/Deployment--GetAround_delay_analysis_and_pricing_optimization/tree/main/rental_price_predictor))

## Deliverables

- Web dashboard for delay analysis and simulations : **https://acsts-getaround-delay-analysis.herokuapp.com/**
- Web app hosting the MLFlow tracking server : **https://acsts-getaround-mlflow-server.herokuapp.com/**
- Web API for car rental price predictions : **https://acsts-getaround-price-predict.herokuapp.com/**
