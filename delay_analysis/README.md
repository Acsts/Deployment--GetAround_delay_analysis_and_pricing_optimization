# GetAround deployment - Subproject : Delay Analysis Dashboard

## Goal of the subproject

At times, users who rented a car on GetAround are late for their checkout, and it can hinder the next rental of the same vehicle, impacting the quality of service and customer satisfaction. The goal of this subproject is to deploy an online dashboard in order to help GetAround:
- measure the issue's importance 
- simulate the impacts that implementing a minimum time delta between two consecutive rentals of the same car would have on business

## Result

The online dashboard can be viewed here : https://acsts-getaround-delay-analysis.herokuapp.com/
